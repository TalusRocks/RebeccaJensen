    <p>Hello! You can call me 'RJ.' I'm an enthusiastic UX Designer who asks a lot of questions before pushing pixels or slinging code. In my world, a great design is not one that does fancy tricks, but one that best meets user goals.
    <br></br>From scratch, my UX/web design process includes conducting user interviews, sending out surveys, assembling user personas, constructing sitemaps, sketching user flows, wireframing layouts, building prototypes, and testing them. I do all this before I get to the business of visual and graphic design. Yes, I am a unicorn. I organize information and I make it beautiful too. I also love to draw, orienteer, and ride bikes.
    <br></br>
    I'm available for part-time, full-time, and freelance work in UX, web, or visual design. I am also available for freelance graphic design and illustration.</p>
